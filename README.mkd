# vim-fidget - JsFiddle for Vim
## What??
This is a plugin (with a very creative name!) that emulates JsFiddle in vim and lets you post it to actual jsfiddle.com so that it can be shared.

## Why??
I am a web developer and the whole concept of trying out small chunks of programs makes JsFiddle really cool **BUT...**

**WHERE IS MY VIM....?** this plugin answers that (it also does *live update* say whatt)

## Dependencies

- Python 2.6+ or 3.3+

## How to use ??
It adds two commands

`VimFidgetBrowse` : upload the fidget to jsfiddle
Also the server dies when you quit index.html buffer

## Credits:
- I took a lot of ideas from (and some code!) [vim-fiddle](https://github.com/mharju/vim-fiddle)
- Also for using nodeJs and other stuff I looked(and took some code) at [suan/vim-instant-markdown](https://github.com/suan/vim-instant-markdown)

## That's it for today Folks!!!
